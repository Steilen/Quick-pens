# Virtual Keyboard

This project implements a virtual keyboard with a modern design, 3D effects, and a unique red backlight feature. The keyboard can simulate key presses and provide a visually appealing interface for web applications.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The keyboard adjusts its layout based on the screen size, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Dark Theme:** The keyboard has a dark theme with a dark gray background and keys, providing a sleek and modern look.
- **3D Effects:** Each key has a shadow and an inset effect to create a 3D appearance.
- **Key Press Simulation:** Keys visually respond to user input, simulating a real key press with shadow and color changes.
- **Red Backlight Mode:** The keyboard features a toggleable red backlight mode for a unique visual effect.
- **Disabled Text Selection:** Users cannot select text within the keyboard area, providing a seamless interaction experience.
- **No Copying:** The keyboard prevents copying of its content, ensuring the design integrity.

## Layout

The keyboard includes standard keys for a typical QWERTY layout:
- **Alphanumeric Keys:** A-Z, 0-9
- **Function Keys:** Tab, Caps Lock, Shift, Ctrl, Alt, etc.
- **Special Characters:** ~, -, =, [, ], \, ;, ', ,, ., /
- **Spacebar:** A larger key for the space function

## Red Backlight Mode

The keyboard includes a special red backlight mode, which can be toggled by clicking on the sun icon key. When enabled, the backlight adds a red shadow to the keys and changes the text color to red. 

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initialize the Keyboard:** Simply load the `index.html` in a web browser to view and interact with the virtual keyboard.
2. **Simulate Key Presses:** Press any key on your physical keyboard to see the corresponding key on the virtual keyboard light up.
3. **Toggle Red Backlight:** Click on the sun icon key to toggle the red backlight mode on and off.

## Customization

You can customize the keyboard by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files:

- **HTML:** Adjust the layout and structure of the keyboard keys.
- **CSS:** Change the styles, colors, and effects of the keys.
- **JavaScript:** Add new features or modify existing functionality for key interactions.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the keyboard layout and structure.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the keyboard and keys.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file handling key press simulation and red backlight toggle.
